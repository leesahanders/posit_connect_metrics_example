Disclaimer from Katie: 
> In the past, content visits for Plumber, Voila, Streamlit, Dash, and Bokeh were over-counted.  The counting was corrected in Connect v 2023.10 for metrics collected going forward.
> When querying the Connect server API endpoint /v1/instrumentation/content/visits , the version of the data counting method is reported in the field min_data_version. This is, by default, set to 3 which returns the correct counts.  They may have some older data recorded with a min_data_version less than 3, but it may not be accurate.
